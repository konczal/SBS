This is a reposity of code used for population genomic analyses of the spoon-billed sandpiper and red-necked stint genomes. Data required for the analyses: reference genome and its annotation can be found in the 00_Data directory. Slighly improved version of the reference genome is now also available at the NCBI (NCBI assembly: ASM369795v1), together with all the sequenicing reads used for the analyses (under the NCBI Bioproject PRJNA419629).

There are pipelines: one based on the bcftools (01_snps directory) and the other based on the genotype likelihoods calculated with angsd (02_angsd direcotry). Each directory descring a pipeline includes separeate README file with detailed description.
