This is a reposity of code used for population genetic analyses of the spoon-billed sandpiper and red-necked stint genomes. 

00_Data directory contains gene annotaion file and reference genome used for the analyses.

01_snp directory contains files unsed for calling SNPs and calculate  using bcftools.

02_angsd contains scrits used to call SNPs and calculate stats based on analyses with angsd. 


The refenrece genome is now available at the NCBI (NCBI assembly: ASM369795v1) and population genomic analyses are based on the samples availble from the NCBI Bioproject: PRJNA419629.
